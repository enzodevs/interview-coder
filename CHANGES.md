### Security Enhancements

1. **Secure Encryption Key Management**:

   - Implemented different output parsing for English mode to properly structure responses
   - Adapted solution generation to provide comprehensive English language assistance

3. **User Interface**:
   - Added UI toggle in Settings Dialog to easily switch between Code and English modes
   - Maintained a consistent interface while supporting both types of exercises

### Improved Startup Process

1. **Desktop Shortcut Creation**:
   - Added `create-desktop-shortcut.bat` to automatically create a desktop shortcut
   - The shortcut launches the application in stealth mode without requiring terminal
   - Proper icon and description for better Windows integration
   - Eliminates the need to keep a terminal window open

These changes fix the issues while preserving the original app's look and feel, just removing the payment restrictions and making everything work properly.
